    <h1 class="header">What is Bitcoin?</h1>

    <p class="description">
        Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency meaning that it
        operates without the supervision of a sole administrator.
        As the first decentralized cryoptocurrency, it has gathered
        increasingly more widespread recogniton and adoption. In fact,
        El Salvador's government has legalized it's use as legal tender apart
        from the United States Dollar.

    <p class="description">

        The currency is divided into "bitcoins" in which the lowest possible units are
        denominated as "satoshis", in recognition of the asset's unknown creator or
        creators' likely pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto.
